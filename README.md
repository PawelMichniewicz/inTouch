[WIP]

inTouch - an alternative online communicator with different end point clients. Just a playground to hone my .net programming skills.
day 0 idea is to make:
 - server deployed on docker with a database (maybe a non-SQL one cause I never tried it)
 - simple console client for easy prototyping
 - proper desktop app with WPF
 - web app
 - keep an eye out for .net MAUI

let's see what I will end with
